		<h2> About me </h2>
		<p> I have been programming games since 2009 when I was twelve in scratch remaking games like tron and call of duty in 2D.
			My whole academic life since then has been driven by my passion for games and I was lucky enough to do 'Computing' at GCSE and ALEVEL (at 16 and 18).
			From this I built up an early foundation of good coding practices and by the time I got to university for my undergraduate degree in computer science,
			I had already programmed in Python, C# and C++. During Univeristy I gained an indepth knowledge of C++, C# and physX as well as learning haskell, pure OPP, matlab,
			SQLite, javascript, java, android development (using android studio) and in my spare time, extensive knowledge of Unity development.
			In this portfolio you will find practical projects I did in and before university and personal projects on the side, including an RTS game I worked on for a year
			and my most recent project in procedual content generation for action-adventure games.
